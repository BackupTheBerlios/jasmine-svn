Jasmine-MySQL Installation

This is the installation procedure for Jasmine-MySQL. More
information and (Maybe ;-)) user feedback can be found at
http://nayco.free.fr/ (Look for "jasmine" in the page). Both
french and english documentations are there, as well as php
api docs.

/* Example names: I used here 'jasmine' as MySQL user, 'sql_password'
as password, 'print' for the database name and 'mysql.here.com'
for the host. */

1- Create a database named for example 'print', on your MySQL
server, using the MySQL admin credentials:
$ mysql -h mysql.here.com -u sql_admin_login -p sql_admin_password
mysql> CREATE DATABASE print;

2- Create a MySQL user, for example 'jasmine'. Grant this user
ALL rights on the print database:
mysql> GRANT ALL ON print.* TO jasmine@CUPS_SERVER IDENTIFIED BY 'sql_password';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3- Run the sql file into your database server, using the
'jasmine' user credentials:
# mysql -h mysql.here.com -u sql_login -p sql_password print < jasmine.sql

That's all. You may use a tool like Mysqlcc (http://mysql.com) to manage
your database easily...

NOTE : If you're upgrading from 0.0.1, you may want to keep your
       data; just use an ALTER statement like this :
       mysql> ALTER jobs_log ADD server tinytext NOT NULL;
