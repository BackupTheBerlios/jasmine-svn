 JASmine, print accounting for Cups

====================================

This is JASmine version 0.0.2. This code is in early
developpement state, so do not expect for miracles !

However, it already accounts prints jobs and stores
the results to a MySQL database, and displays simple
reports on a web page; but sometimes (often ;)) these
results are not accurate, so do not use these reports
for print billing !!!

Anyway, feel free to report bugs, send comments or
feature requests to me (nayco@free.fr).

Be sure to read the INSTALL file to setup correctly
this software.
