Changelog for JASmine-Sql-0.0.2

* 30-09-2005
  - Added a "server" field to the "job_log" table, to keep
    track of the Cups server that processed the print job:
    This helps managing several print servers with a single
    database server and a single instance of JASmine-Web.
* 04/10/2005
  - Added the copyright and GNU/GPL notices to all files.
