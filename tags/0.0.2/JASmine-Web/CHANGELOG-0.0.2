 CHANGELOG FOR JASmine-Web-0.0.2

* 30-09-2005: 
  - Now display the print job's originating print server in
    libJasReports.php:jas_getUserLastJobs; this allows to
    monitor more than one print server with only one JASmine
    instance.
* 03-10-2005
  - Added a favicon. It sux. Gotta change it.
  - Added the copyright and GNU/GPL notices to all files
* 05-10-2005
  - Added the "error reporting" styles in the CSS file, but
    they need a good polish.
* 14-10-2005
  - Added detection of MySQL support for PHP: If this lacks,
    JASmine-Web now displays an error message before die()ing.
  - Changed the <title> of the index page from french to
    english ;)
* 24-10-2005
  - Moved all images to the images/ folder.
* 28-10-2005
  - Bill Gates is 50 years old today.
  - Rewritten the css file, JASmine-Web looks a little bit
    better now. Made another version for IE, and added a
    conditionnal statement in header.php to select the sheet
    automatically. The IE version is still crappy, I'll
    rework it later.
  - The user job log now displays the printer by which the
    job was printed. But now the table becomes unreadable, so
    removing fields will be necessary.
  - Added printer stats (show_printer.php) and related
    functions in libJasReports.php.
* 01-11-2005
  - Reworked the stylesheet again. NOW it is nice !
  - Added a printer stylesheet, but there is still a
    long way to go to get it right.
  - Added the GNU GPL notice to the stylesheets; But I'm
    wondering wether I should use a CC By-SA license for
    art files ?
* 02-11-2005
  - Now IE and old browsers have a decent stylesheet.
  - Cleaned the "compliant browsers" stylesheet.
* 06-11-2005
  - Created 'libTables.php' to handle html tables. This
    library will be extended later to support sorting, etc...
  - Replaced calls to DB_dump_result() in libJasReports by
    calls to libTables' functions. This way reports will
    be enhanced in the future.
* 07-11-2005
  - Talking about enhancements, moving libJasReports to
    use libTable enabled me to display links instead of
    printer and user names in the reports tables. Clicking
    on those links displays user or printer stats ! This
    way, JASmine-Web becomes more easy to use.
