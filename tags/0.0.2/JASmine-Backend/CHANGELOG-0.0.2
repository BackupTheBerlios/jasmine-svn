Changelog for JASmine-Backend-0.0.2

* 30-09-2005:
  - Added support for the database's new 'server' field;
    this allows to monitor more than one print server with
    only one JASmine instance.
  - Made various changes to switch from "pdl_analyser" to
    "pkpgcounter".

* 19-10-2005
  - Added a dummy printer backend, to test JASmine without
    actually printing anything: Paper and toner are not
    cheap ;) !!! It is located in the bin/ directory of
    the tarball: Copy it to your Cups backend folder to
    use it, and reload Cups.
  - Redirected pkpgcounter's STDERR output to /dev/null
    when analyzing a file, to prevent wrong interpretation
    by JASmine-backend when an info or error message is
    written.
* 21-10-2005
  - Modified the logging section to use 'warning' syslog
    priority instead of deprecated 'err'.
  - Added calls to openlog() on exits, this is more clean.
  - Added the log_debug() function and a $debug variable
    to activate debug messages only when needed (Typically
    during setup phase).
  - Modified most log_failure() and log_success()
    calls to be log_debug ones. The only log_success() used
    is to report the success of a print job: Now, when in
    production, JASmine-Backend will be less verbose.
  - Added a verbose die() when syslog support is wanted
    but the Sys::Syslog perl module is not installed.
  - Made the "dummy" backend more portable by using the
    "which" command.
  - Modified the "dummy" backend's output to match Cups
    specifications. ("local" => "direct")
* 23-10-2005
  - Modified the "dummy" backend to log debug info with
    user.debug priority.
  - Checking that Pkpgcounter is executable is not useful
    anymore: Removed the corresponding code from JASmine-
    Backend.
  - JASmine-Backend now logs a message when Cups calls it
    for reloading.
