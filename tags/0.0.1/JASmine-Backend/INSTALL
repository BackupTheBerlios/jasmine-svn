Intalling Jasmine-backend

This is the installation procedure for Jasmine-backend. More
information and (Maybe ;-)) user feedback can be found at
http://nayco.free.fr/ (Look for "jasmine" in the page). Both
french and english documentations are there, as well as php
api docs.

Ok, go on:

* Pdl_analyser.py installation

  This file is located in the directory 'pdl_analyser/'. It is part
  of the 'PyKota' print accounting project, much more advanced than
  mine, and is developped by Jerome Alet.

  1- Copy "pdl_analyser.py" in a directory of your choice, typically
     /usr/bin. Chown it '944' to 'root'. There is no need to make it
     executable.
  2- Ensure that you have Ghostscript installed, and the executable
     'gs' is in root's $PATH. This should be the case in most distros,
     like Mandriva and Ubuntu.
  3- Check that Python is installed. The version I use is Python2.3,
     feel free to try with other versions... Usually, the Python
     executable is located in /usr/bin/python.

* Backend installation

  1- Copy the perl script 'jasmine' into Cups's backend directory
     (Usually '/usr/lib/cups/backend', like in Mandriva and Ubuntu),
     and chown it '755' to 'root'.
  2- Check that you have Perl 5.8 installed (By default in Mandriva
     and Ubuntu), and that the perl executable is locate at
     '/usr/bin/perl'.
  4- Youâ€™ll need the DBI and MySQL perl modules installed (
     'urpmi perl-DBI perl-mysql' with Mandriva, and 'sudo apt-get
     install libdbd-mysql-perl' with Ubuntu)
  5- Do not forget to run the sql script into your MySQL server ! See
     the INSTALL file in the 'Jasmine-MySQL' archive.
  6- Modify the JASmine backend by editing the variables at the
     beginning of the file: Make the variables point to the right paths,
     specify the MySQL password, login, host and database.
     --
     my $DBhost="mysql.here.com";
     my $DBlogin="jasmine";
     my $DBpassword="sql_passowrd";
     my $DBdatabase="print";
     #
     # If you want to use Syslog, set this to 1. Should be used for
     # debugging, not in production... To disable, set 0.
     my $Want_Sys_Syslog=1;
     #
     # Location of the Python binary and Pykota's analyzer.
     my $path_to_pldanalyser="/usr/bin/pdl_analyser.py";
     my $path_to_python="/usr/bin/python";
     --
  7- Reload Cups, connect to 'http://cups_server:631', use this inteface
     to setup a new printer. Be sure to choose '....(Quota managed)' for
     the driver (URI beginning with 'jasmine:...") ! Then print something
     on this printer and look at the 'jobs_log' table in the database to
     see if the number of pages is logged... Do not forget to check Cups's
     logs and your syslog to find about errors.
  8- Install 'Jasmine-Web', and play with it ;-).

That's all !
